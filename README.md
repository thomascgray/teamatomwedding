# teamatomwedding
NodeJS information hub for mine and my better half's wedding, plus a chat app!

Real time, anonymous chat app I smashed out in one mental evening to give the nerdier of the guests something to do (*WARNING: My friends are basically all scumbags, so the content of the chat app may be extremely NSFW. Look at your own risk*)

Unfortunately, the app and server are no longer hosted anywhere. I want to keep the code around for posterity however.

// @TODO

- when I get the time, make the client ES6 via Babel!
- refactor the server to not be awful (it was one evening, OK?!)
